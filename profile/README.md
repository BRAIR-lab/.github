## BRAin Inspired Robotics Laboratory
Welcome to our Github profile page. BRAIR Lab (BRAin-Inspired Robotics Laboratory) carries out research on brain models for motor control, sensory-motor coordination, and cognition in autonomous robots. The underlining idea is that cognitive abilities, in the same way as they work in humans and other living beings, would help the new-generation robots to be coherent, persistent in behaviour and aware of themselves and the environment.
Cognitive models require the integration of neurophysiology, neuroscience, developmental studies, and artificial intelligence with robotics. At the same time, such robotic implementations contribute to experimental validation of the biological models. They give the possibility not only to describe biological solutions through biomimetic technologies but, more importantly, to explain why the biological solutions have been shaped the way they are. To this end, we also seamlessly combine brain-inspired models with the embodied intelligence of soft robots.
