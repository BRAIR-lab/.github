Welcome to our Github profile page! :wave: 

**BRAIR Lab** (BRAin-Inspired Robotics Laboratory) carries out research on brain models for:
- Motor control, 
- Sensory-motor coordination, 
- Cognition in autonomous robots. 

The underlining idea is that cognitive abilities, in the same way as they work in humans and other living beings, would help the new-generation robots to be coherent, persistent in behaviour and aware of themselves and the environment.

Cognitive models require the integration of *neurophysiology*, *neuroscience*, *developmental studies*, a*nd artificial intelligence* with robotics. At the same time, such robotic implementations contribute to experimental validation of the *biological models*. They give the possibility not only to describe biological solutions through biomimetic technologies but, more importantly, to explain **why the biological solutions have been shaped the way they are**. To this end, we also seamlessly combine brain-inspired models with the embodied intelligence of **soft robots**.
